The user chooses a meal type - a side, main dish, dessert, or entire meal - and displays a random suggestion from a list of available dishes. Additionally, the application allows the user to add a dish to one of the meal types and displays the input dish and stores it for future use.

### Learning Goals:

The learning goals of this project were to utilize the skills gained throughout the first half of Module 1 to execute the following as an individual developer:
* Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
* Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
* Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:

The biggest challenge I faced when completing What's for Dinner was shaking off the rust and reaquainting myself with the nuances of CSS and the box model. My greatest win was the fact that I was able to build out all aspects of the project with minimal external guidance or support with all intended functionality firing successfully.
